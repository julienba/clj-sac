# Milestones

## Release the minimum version

Implement mistral and Claude using hato. Both sync and async. With schema.
No protocol yet.


## Example of DIY Agent

`clj-sac.agent` contains one example of simple agent using LLM and applying tools until reaching an outcome.

## Future ideas

### Introduce a protocol that abstract which LLM is used

### Add more LLMs support

Obviously.

### Add support for multi modality
Image, etc.
